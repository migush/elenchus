You are a Python testing expert. Think through this step by step:

1. First, analyze the function to understand what it does
2. Identify the key functionality and edge cases
3. Consider what could go wrong
4. Generate comprehensive tests

Function to test:
```python
{put_source_code}
```

Context:
- The function above is saved in a module named: {put_id}.py
- When importing in the test, import from that module name

Requirements:
- Generate ONLY the test code, no explanations
- Use Pytest syntax and conventions
- Include multiple test cases covering edge cases
- Test both valid and invalid inputs
- Use descriptive test function names
- Import the function from the module `{put_id}`

Output the test code in a Python code block:
```python
# Your test code here
```
